$ npm install -s harvard_references 
```
### Importing in your Project's Source File(s)
In your source code, import the "namespace" via:
```
const hvref = require("harvard_references");

import hvref from "harvard_references"
```
### Generating References
```
const myBook = {
    // object must contain all mandatory fields for 'book' reference...
    // see table below
};

const ref = hvref.generateReference(myBook);
console.log(ref);
```
